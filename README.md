# Christmas Tree Farm POS System

A friend of mine has a christmas tree farm in New England which has been continuously running for over 40 years. After multiple trips to the farm and organic discussions around life that included the christmas tree farm I came to admire there attention to detail and bookkeeping but also came to the realization that their entire business process reveolved around cash and paper and pen accounting books. While they rarely had missingness or gaps in their sales, that had instances of mismatching books to cash drawers as a result of refunds and family/friends freebie and discounts which frutserated their maticulous nature. Therefore I decided to build them an express app they could use as a POS system.

This is one of my first express apps and is a living and breathing project, with admittedly much room for growth. I am open to suggestions, questions and tweaks and excited to see how this products grows while also helping others.
